## Hola, I'm Esteban Duran 👋

I am a software engineer based in Austin, Texas currently working on spacecraft
autonomy 🛰️ at [York Space Systems](https://www.yorkspacesystems.com). I am
passionate about making our robot space explorers smarter. My dream is to one
day see smart AI-powered spacecraft exploring our cosmos, sending back
amazing data, and expanding our knowledge of the universe.

This blog is intended to be a collection of posts on anything from spacecraft
autonomy, artificial intelligence, flight software, programming languages, and
space in general.

Feel free to reach out to me via email [📧](mailto:astroesteban@icloud.com) or
social media. **Tambien hablo español!**
